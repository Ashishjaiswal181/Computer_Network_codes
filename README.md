# Network related codes and algorithm implementation.

The codes include one dimentional and two dimentional _Parity check, Priority and Round Robin scheduler_ , Contagious subsequence code, identifying the topology of a graph(_Ring, Mesh or Star_) and _Mean, Median and Mode_ codes.

Code for *distance vector algorith* added that gives the routing table for all the nodes.

##### This repository will include codes executed my me on network related problems only.
