# Network related codes and algorithm implementation.

The codes include one dimentional and two dimentional _Parity check, Priority and Round Robin scheduler_ , Contagious subsequence code, identifying the topology of a graph(_Ring, Mesh or Star_) and _Mean, Median and Mode_ codes.

Code for *distance vector algorith* added that gives the routing table for all the nodes.

Code for ARQ mechanism like *Stop-and-wait, Go-Back-N and Selective* Repeat added.

Code for implementation of *Banker's Algorithm* to avoid *deadlock* added.

Code for memory allocation algorithms (*Best Fit, Worst Fit and First Fit*) added.

Code for *Socket programming* added which includes both the server and client side code.

##### This repository will include codes executed my me on network related problems only.
